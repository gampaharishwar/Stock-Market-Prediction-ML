Introduction:
Stock market prediction involves forecasting the future value of stocks based on historical data and financial indicators. 
This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions, assisting investors in making informed decisions.

Project Setup:
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-prediction-ml.git
cd stock-market-prediction-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Collection:
We collected historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance. 
The dataset includes various financial indicators necessary for predicting stock prices.

Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing steps include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering. 
These steps ensure the data is in the right format for training machine learning models.

Model Development:
We implemented several machine learning models, including:
Linear Regression
LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
Random Forest
The LSTM model was chosen for its ability to handle time-series data effectively.

Performance Evaluation:
The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to ensure accuracy and reliability in predictions.

Results:
Our models achieved high accuracy in predicting stock prices, with the LSTM model performing the best. 
Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the results folder.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates that machine learning, particularly LSTM, can effectively predict stock market trends. 
The predictions can help investors make better investment decisions.
